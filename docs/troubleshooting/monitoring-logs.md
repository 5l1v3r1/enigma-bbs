ENiGMAÂ½ does not produce much to stdout. Logs are produced by Bunyan which outputs each entry as a 
JSON object. 

Start by installing bunyan and making it available on your path:

    npm install bunyan -g
    
To tail logs in a colorized and pretty format, issue the following command:
    
    tail -F /path/to/enigma-bbs/logs/enigma-bbs.log | bunyan
