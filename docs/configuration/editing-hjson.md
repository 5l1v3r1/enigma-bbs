title: Editing Hjson
---
Hjson is a syntax extension to JSON. It's NOT a proposal to replace JSON or to incorporate it into the JSON spec itself. 
It's intended to be used like a user interface for humans, to read and edit before passing the JSON data to the machine.

You can find more info at the [Hjson.org website](http://hjson.org/).

## Editor Plugins
### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has a nice Hjson extension that can be installed from
within the IDE. It provides syntax highlighting to make it clear when you've made a syntax mistake within
a config file.
