## About File Areas

### A Different Approach
ENiGMAÂ½ has strayed away from the old familiar setup here and instead takes a more modern approach:
* [Gazelle](https://whatcd.github.io/Gazelle/) inspired system for searching & browsing files.
* No conferences (just areas!)
* File areas are still around but should *generally* be used less. Instead, files can have one or more tags. Think things like `dos.retro`, `pc.warez`, `games`, etc.

### Other bells and whistles
* Temporary web (http:// or https://) download links in additional to standard X/Y/Z protocol support. Batch downloads of many files can be downloaded as a single ZIP archive.
* Users can star rate files & search/filter by ratings
* Concept of user defined filters/searches including the ability to save them. For example, "Latest Artscene Releases".
* A given area can span one to many physical storage locations.
* Upload processor can extract and use `FILE_ID.DIZ`/`DESC.SDI`, for standard descriptions as well as `README.TXT`, `*.NFO`, and so on for longer descriptions. The processor also attempts release year estimation by scanning aforementioned description file(s).
* Fast indexed Full Text Search (FTS) across descriptions and filenames.
* Duplicates are checked for by SHA-256.
* Support for many archive and file formats. External utilities can easily be added to the configuration to extend for additional formats.
* Much, much more!
