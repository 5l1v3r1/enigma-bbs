title: Install Script
---
Under most Linux/UNIX like environments (Linux, BSD, OS X, ...)  new users can simply execute the 
`install.sh` script to get everything up and running. Cut + paste the following into your terminal:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NuSkooler/enigma-bbs/0.0.9-alpha/misc/install.sh | bash
```

It is recommended you review the [installation script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NuSkooler/enigma-bbs/0.0.9-alpha/misc/install.sh) 
on GitHub before running it. 

The script will install nvm, Node.js 6 and grab the latest ENiGMA BBS from GitHub. It will also guide you 
through creating a basic configuration file, and recommend some packages to install.
