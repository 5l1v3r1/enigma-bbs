# ENiGMA½ BBS Software

ENiGMA½ is a modern BBS software with a nostalgic flair!


## Feature Available Now

 * Multi node
 * Highly customizable via [HJSON](http://hjson.org/) based configuration, menus, and theming in addition to JS based mods
 * MCI support for lightbars, toggles, input areas, other bells and whistles you expect with a modern flare
 * Telnet & SSH access built in. Additional servers are easy to build & plug in
 * [CP437](http://www.ascii-codes.com/) and UTF-8 output
 * [SyncTerm](http://syncterm.bbsdev.net/) style font and baud emulation support. Display PC/DOS and Amiga style artwork as it's intended!

## In the Works
* Lots of code cleanup, and **documentation**
* FTN import & export
* File areas
* Missing functionality such as searching, pipe code support in message areas, etc.
* A lot more!

## Alpha
As of now this is considered alpha code! Please **expect bugs** -- and when you find them, log issues and/or submit pull requests. Feature requests, suggestions, and so on are always welcome! I am also looking for semi dedicated testers, artists, etc.
