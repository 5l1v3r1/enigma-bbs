        General Information
        ------------------------------- -   -
        This configuration is in HJSON (http://hjson.org/) format. Strict to-spec
        JSON is also perfectly valid. Use "hjson" from npm to convert to/from JSON.

        See http://hjson.org/ for more information and syntax.

        Various editors and IDEs such as Sublime Text 3 Visual Studio Code and so
        on have syntax highlighting for the HJSON format which are highly recommended.

        Achievement Configuration
        ------------------------------- -   -
        Achievements are currently fairly limited in what can trigger them. This is
        being expanded upon and more will be available in the near future. For now
        you should mostly be interested in:
        - Perhaps adding additional *levels* of triggers & points
        - Applying customizations via the achievements section in theme.hjson

        Some tips:
        - For 'userStat' types, see user_property.js

        Don"t forget to RTFM ...er uh... see the documentation for more information and
        don"t be shy to ask for help:
